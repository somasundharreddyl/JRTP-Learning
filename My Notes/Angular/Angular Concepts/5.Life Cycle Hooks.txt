1.ngOnChanges() => When we are getting input from Parent Component to Child Component then this ngOnChanges() will Execute.

2.ngOnInit() => whenever a Component is created then this ngOnInit() is Initialized. It is Initialized only once.

3.ngDoCheck() => In Some Conditions, ngOnChanges() won't execute eventhough We change value of Input which is coming from Parent Component.

What are those Conditions?
--------------------------
if we are changing string character value,array value or object property.Here the reference of object is same, only the values in object are changing,not reference.In these conditions, ngOnChanges won't execute.

For that we use ngDoCheck().

4.ngAfterViewInit() => is executed when DOM Tree(View-HTML) is created.

5.ngAfterViewChecked() => is Executed whenever there is an Element modification(style change,element deletion) happened on view.

6.ngAfterContentInit() => 

   child.html:
   -----------
   <p>This is Child Component<p>
   <ng-content><ng-content>


   Parent.html:
   -------------
   <p>This is Parent Component<p>
   <app-child>
    
    <p> Won't display the content that writes here.If you want to display
content that writes here then use ng-content in child.html                  </p>
    <h2>{{testvariable}}<h2>
   
   </app-chil>

 Note : whenever we are Projecting content in between <app-Child></app-child> from Parent to Child Component, then this ngAfterContentInit() is initialized.

7.ngAfterContentChecked() => is execute whenever there is a change in content between <app-Child></app-child> like testVariable input,ngAfterContentChecked() is initialized.

8.ngOnDestroy() => is execute when a component is changed or destroyed(like next page /home to /products).

if you want to stop executing scroll bars functionalities in previous component then we implement that logic in ngOnDestroy().


Note:
Execute in EveryComponent : ngOnInit(), ngOnDestroy(), ngAfterViewInit(), ngAfterViewChecked()

Execute when and only get Input fromParent Comp : ngOnChanges(),ngDocheck()

Execute when and only if projecting content from Parent
 to Child Component :  ngAfterContentInit(), ngAfterContentChecked()
