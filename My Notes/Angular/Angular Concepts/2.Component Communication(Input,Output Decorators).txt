Component Communication:
-----------------------
In Angular we can achieve component to component communication with input and output functions. @Input ==> If we want to send the any type of data (string/integer/json/array) from one component to other component we can use @Input decorator.

Example: VisitingCard component want to dispaly a username as input from App Component

VistingCardComponent

AppComponent

@Input('<inputvariablename>') localvariable:any="";

<app-visitingcard inputvariablename="Vijay Kumar">

ngOnInit(){

we can use localvariable in visiting card component

}

We cant use the localvariable declared in @Input inside constructor. Because Constructor is only called once when component in initialized and ngOnint is used for taking the localvaraible.

If we wan to have dynamic variable then we need to use property binding

<app-visitingcard [inputvariablename]='username' > and username should be assigned in app component.



@Output Decorator:
-------------------
whenever we want to emit an event from one component to another component(especially child Component to Parent Component). we use @Output Decorator.

@Output Decorator comes with EventEmitter which is predefined interface.

events like (change),(click),(pressdown).

Ex:
{
selectedButton:string="All";

@Output()
selectedButtonEvent:EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();

onChange(){
  this.selectedButtonEvent.emit(this.selectedButton);
}
}
