==================
Service Registry
==================

=> Service Registry is used to maintain all apis information like name, status, url and health at once place.

=> It is also called as Service Discovery. 

=> We can use Eureka Server as service registry.

=> It will provide user interface to get apis info.



===============================================================
Steps to develop Service Registry Application (Eureka Server)
===============================================================

1) Create Service Registry application with below dependency

	 - EurekaServer (spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server)

2) Configure @EnableEurekaServer annotation in boot start class

3) Configure below properties in application.yml file

server:
  port: 8761
  
eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false

Note: If Service-Registry project port is 8761 then clients can discover service-registry and will register automatically with service-registry. If service-registry project running on any other port number then we have to register clients with service-registry manually.

4) Once application started we can access Eureka Dashboard using below URL

		URL : http://localhost:8761/
