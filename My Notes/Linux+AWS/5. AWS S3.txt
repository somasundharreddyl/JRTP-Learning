========
AWS S3
========

=> S3 stands for simple storage service

=> S3 is used for unlimited storage

=> S3 works based on Object storage (object=file)

=> S3 is a paid service (for storing & for retrieving)

=> S3 maintains data using buckets concept

=> Bucket means group of objects

		ex :     netflix_tollywood_movies_bucket
			 netflix_bollywood_movies_bucket
			 netflix_hollywood_movies_bucket

Note: When we create bucket, aws will generate one URL for that.

=> When we upload object in the bucket then object url will be generated.

=> Bucket Name should be Globally Unique.

=> Using S3 service we can host static website also.

=================================
Static website hosting using s3
=================================

=> Website means collection of web pages (html + css + js)

Step-1 : Create S3 bucket

			- Enable ACL
			- Allow Public Acc

Step-2 : Upload website files (index.html & error.html) as objects in bucket

			- Grant Public Read Access

Step-3 : Enable Static Website hosting

			(bucket -> properties -> Static website hosting)

Step-4 : Access website URL


=================
S3 Lab Practice
=================

1) Create bucket in s3. a)Enable ACL(access to People)

2) upload object in s3

===========
Assignment
===========

1) Develop spring boot web application to store course details

			- course name
			- course duration
			- course price
			- course image

Note: Course image should be stored into AWS s3 bucket and course info should be stored into db table.	

Note: To implement this task we need IAM user with S3FullAccess & Security Credentials of IAM user.

Note: We need to use AWS SDK to perform this operation.(Not AWS User Interface or Aws CLI).
