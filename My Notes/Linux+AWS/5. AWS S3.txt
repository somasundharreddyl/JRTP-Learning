========
AWS S3
========

=> S3 stands for simple storage service

=> S3 is used for unlimited storage

=> S3 works based on Object storage (object=file)

=> S3 is a paid service (for storing & for retriving)

=> S3 maintains data using buckets concept

=> Bucket means group of objects

		ex : netflix_tollywood_movies_bucket
			 netflix_bollywood_movies_bucket
			 netflix_hollywood_movies_bucket

Note: When we create bucket, aws will generate one URL for that.

=> When we upload object in the bucket then object url will be generated.
