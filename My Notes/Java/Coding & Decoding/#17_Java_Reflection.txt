Note : Reflection breaks Singleton Design Pattern.
       We can avoid that By implementing lines in Private Constructor.

         private constructor(){
                if(obj==null){new Constructor()}
                else{return obj;}
          }



Note : Why Avoid Reflection?
       - Slow : all executions and change in behaviour of class,methods and constructor happens at Runtime. so it is slow.
