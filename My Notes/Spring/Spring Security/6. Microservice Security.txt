================================
Microservices with JWT Security
===============================

=> Auth-Service contains functionality for user registration and user login with MySQL DB. 

=> If user login successfully then auth-service will generate JWT token and will send it as response to user.

=> API-Gateway contains logic to validate the token using Filter.

Note: In API-Gateway we have added routings for our microservices along with Filter.

=> When we access any microservice url through api-gateway then api-gateway will execute filter to validate the token. If token is valid then only api-gateway will route the request to particular microservice. If token is invalid then api-gateway will throw Exception.
